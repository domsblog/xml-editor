This is a free little script I created for my personal use…

Specifically, there was a need in the network sites for a PHP script that could create database entries and from those it would generate an XML file. I sat down one afternoon and developed it. It still has a basic interface and all the features I wanted haven’t been implemented yet (probably later on in a revised version) but the basic function is there:

    * Admin area with self-expiry cookie.
    * Preview all the database entries.
    * Add a new entry with a simple form.
    * XML file created automatically on every update.

The first place we used it was the news scroll over the network’s main site, kdiweb.net (you can view the scroll on the homepage in the sidebar).
